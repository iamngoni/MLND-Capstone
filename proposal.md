## Proposal
Plant Disease Detection using Pytorch and Fastai

### Domain Background

As the world grows in population every year the demand for food is also rising, however a growing threat in the form of plant diseases threatens to worsen the already strained food supply on the continent. 

Pest and disease induced crop losses have devasted farms across the world but thanks to advances in machine learning farmers can detect diseases early through the use of computer vision in the browser or on a mobile device.


### Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to fit a Convolutional Neural Network on the data using the Fastai library and Pytorch. I am going to use transfer Learning with ResNet, a deep residual learning framework developed at Microsoft in order to achieve accurate classification of the plant images. 

### Datasets and Inputs

The PlantVillage dataset consists of 54303 healthy and unhealthy leaf images divided into 38 categories by species and disease.

The images span 14 crop species: Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Grape, Orange, Peach, Bell Pepper, Potato, Raspberry, Soybean, Squash, Strawberry, and Tomato. It contains images of 17 fundal diseases, 4 bacterial diseases, 2 mold (oomycete) diseases, 2 viral diseases, and 1 disease caused by a mite. 12 crop species also have images of healthy leaves that are not visibly affected by a disease.

### Solution Statement

The solution will be a fastai classification model capable of correctly identifying whether an image contains a specfic plant disease or not with a high accuracy and deploy it in a web app for farmers to use.

### Benchmark Model

For this problem, the benchmark model will be resnet-152 pytorch classifier developed by Viridiana Romero Martinez as referenced in her medium article https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/creating-an-ai-app-that-detect-diseases-in-plants-using-facebooks-deep-learning-platform-pytorch-15faaeb6bec3. The model produced a high accuracy score, 96.1% and the goal is to see if fastai and another resnet can improve on that.

### Evaluation Metrics

The model will evaluated on accuracy and loss in classifying the images correctly.

### Project Design

The project is expected to follow the steps below:

* Data exploration
* Model selection
* Training and validation
* Summarisation of the results
